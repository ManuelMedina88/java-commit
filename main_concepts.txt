The process-oriented model can be thought of as code acting on data.  ref. 254,6 / 2051

Object-oriented programming organizes a program around its data (that is, objects) and a set of well-defined interfaces to that data. An object-oriented program can be characterized as data controlling access to code. ref 255,1 / 2051

the data defined by the class are referred to as member variables or instance variables.

The code that operates on that data is referred to as member methods or just methods.

Polymorphism (from Greek, meaning “many forms”) is a feature that allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions.

In Java, a source file is officially called a compilation unit.
